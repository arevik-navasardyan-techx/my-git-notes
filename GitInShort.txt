###GIT
- Git is a system that helps track changes in your code,
 collaborate with others, and manage the history of a project. 
- A repository (or repo) is a storage space where your project,
 along with all of its history (commits), configuration, and branches, is stored.


 ## Commands
 //create local repo
 git init
 //clone existing repo
 git clone repoLink
 //link Local Repository to Remote Repository
 git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git


- A branch is a separate line of development. The main (or master) branch is the
 default branch in a repository, but you can create as many additional branches as needed
 and modify them without affecting main branch  


 ##  Commands
 //Create a New Branch
git branch <branch-name>
 //Switch Between Branches
git checkout <branch-name>
 //Create a New Branch and switch on it
git checkout -b <branch-name>
 //Make Changes in the Feature Branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature xyz"
 //Merge a Branch
git checkout main      # Switch to the main branch first
git merge <branch-name>

- Make branches small, to avoid even big conflicts afterwards.
